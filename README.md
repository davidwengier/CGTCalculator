# CGT Calculator

A capital gains tax calculator, with a simple UI for entering shares, and computing values to help with filing tax returns in Australia.

This is mostly an exercise in writing a Blazor app, though it happens to be hosted in a WinForms app because I'm weird like that. If this app ever actually gets to the point of doing any calculations, they should not be relied upon for accuracy, and you should do your own work to file your tax return. This could be useful to verify your work though.
